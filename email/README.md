# Awesome Email Services

This README tracks email services that are crypto and privacy friendly. Email is the most fundamental source of identity on the internet. It's hard to do anything without one. This page has resources for anonymously obtaining an email address from a privacy respecting, crypto-friendly service.

## Temporary Email

Temporary email sites provide throw-away email addresses. You can use them for email service providers that require an alternative email address when signing up.

## Email Aliases

Email aliases allow you to create a 'proxy' email address, that then forwards the email on to your 'real' email address. Once you have done the hard work of establishing an email service (below), you can use email aliases to multiply the effective number of emails you have to work with.
